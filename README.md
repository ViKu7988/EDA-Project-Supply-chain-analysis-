Overview
This project analyzes a supply chain dataset with attributes such as product types, SKU, price, availability, sales, revenue, stock levels, lead times, and defect rates. The goal is to derive actionable insights to improve supply chain efficiency and effectiveness.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 100 records covering:

Product Types: Cosmetics, Haircare, Skincare
Metrics: Price, Sales, Revenue, Stock Levels, Lead Times, Order Quantities, Shipping Times/Costs, Manufacturing Lead Time/Costs, Defect Rates, Transportation Modes

## Project Steps
1. Price vs. Revenue Analysis
Scatter plot
Insight: Higher-priced skincare products generate more revenue, indicating strong demand.

2. Sales by Product Type
Pie chart
Insight: Skincare accounts for 45% of sales, the largest revenue driver.

3. Revenue by Shipping Carrier
Bar chart
Insight: Carrier B generates the most revenue but at higher costs.

4. Lead Time & Manufacturing Costs
Analysis
Insight: Cosmetics have the lowest lead time and manufacturing costs.

5. SKU Analysis
Line charts
Insight: Monitoring low stock/high demand SKUs can optimize restocking.

6. Shipping Costs & Transportation Modes
Bar/Pie charts
Insight: Road and rail are the most costly, while air transportation has the lowest defect rates.

7. Defect Rate Analysis
Bar/Pie charts
Insight: Haircare products have higher defect rates, especially by road.


## Key Insights and Recommendations

1. Skincare Focus: Prioritize skincare products to maximize revenue.

2. Carrier Evaluation: Explore cost-effective alternatives to Carrier B.

3. Defect Reduction: Improve quality control for haircare and shift more transportation to air.

4. Inventory Optimization: Prevent stockouts by addressing high-demand, low-stock SKUs.

5. Lead Time Optimization: Reduce lead times for haircare and skincare products.

6. Cost Efficiency: Optimize transportation modes to reduce costs.


## Conclusion:
This analysis highlights key areas for supply chain improvement, including cost reduction, quality enhancement, and inventory management. Continuous monitoring and further analysis are recommended for strategic decision-making.
